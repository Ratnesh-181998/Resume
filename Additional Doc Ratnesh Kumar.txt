Data Scientist  (Ratnesh Kumar) at  Government E Marketplace Since Dec 2021 :

# GeM AI  Chatbot at Government E Marketplace (GeM: https://gem.gov.in/)

Gen AI Chatbot (Ask GeM AI) Developed and integrated LLMs with AWS
Bedrock, fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, leveraging Kendra for vector
databases, Lambda for logging, S3 for storage, and CloudWatch for real-time
monitoring and visualization.

# NLP Search Optimizations  at Government E Marketplace ( https://mkp.gem.gov.in/market )

• NLP Search Engine Optimization Leveraged an NLP Optimizer layer on top of
the existing Apache Solr search solution to enhance user search strings,
improving search accuracy and efficiency. Utilized SymSpell, Verbosity for
spelling correction, integrated Arpa for probabilistic language models, and
implemented a Flask web service to handle search queries. Employed NLTK for
text preprocessing, including word-tokenizer, WhitespaceTokenizer,
stopwords and WordNetLemmatizer.


# Advance Analytics  use case at Government E Marketplace (  https://mkp.gem.gov.in/market ) 

1. Demand Forecasting  :

• Demand Forecasting Developed and deployed demand forecasting models
using ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing for seasonal
products/services, and ML-based models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
to predict product/service demand and pricing based on historical transactions
and external data such as market prices and macroeconomic indicators.

2. Text Search - 

• Text Search Developed a Flask-based API to enforce category-specific image
uploads, ensuring users cannot submit irrelevant images (e.g., laptops in a
mobile category). Utilized Flask-CORS, pandas, and concurrent.futures for
efficient image validation and real-time response handling.

3. Market Intelligence  

• Market Intelligence Implemented a solution to display the price of selected
products across various marketplaces. Utilized Crypto.Cipher for secure data
handling and fuzzywuzzy for string matching accuracy, parsel for efficient
HTML parsing, urllib3,glob for robust HTTP requests and managing file paths.

4. Buyer seller IP 
5. Buyer Seller Collusion 
6. Intentional Hiding of Product 
7. Heath of Bid 

8. Avoiding Order Aggregation  

• Avoiding Order Aggregation Designed a tool to identify abnormal price quotes
by analyzing historical purchase data and price trends. Utilized pymysql for
database interactions and shutil for file operations. Applied logging for robust
error tracking and traceback for detailed exception handling. Ensured code
quality and data integrity with ensure-annotations , facilitating accurate
analysis.
